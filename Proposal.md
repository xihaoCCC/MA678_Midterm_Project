## Personal Statement:
Big Data is one of the most popular topics in society nowadays. Almost every industry meets tons of data every day, and the keys to insight into new
business opportunities are hidden in those data. Thus, as someone who can play with data professionally, a data analyst/scientist/consultant is widely
needed. My career goal is to be a professional in the data area, and I also find myself interested in communicating with others, thus working in the HR
department as a data analyst may be a good choice for me. In this project, I want to stand in the HR position to understand the factors that lead a person
to leave the current job, and try to predict whether a given candidate will leave the current job.

## The data set:
I get this data set from the Kaggle database, the link is https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/hr-analytics-job-change-of-data-scientists. This dataset
includes information of each candidate including their demographics, gender, previous working experience, education level, type of University course
enrolled, the difference in years between previous job and current job, training hours completed, etc. The outcomes are their final decisions, a binary
value indicating whether a candidate leaves the job.

## Two questions I want to ask and answer:
1. Which are the main factors that affect the decision of a candidate?

2. Can we predict whether candidates will stay if given their information?

## Proposed Timeline of work:

I plan to finish EDA before: 11/10/2021

I plan to finish Data Processing before: 11/20/2021

I plan to finish Modeling and Validation before: 11/30/2021

I plan to finish the final report before: 12/2/2021

(the timeline may change a little depedning on the actual status)

## Some concerns:
1.The data owner said the data set is imbalanced, I think I need to further explore where the problem is.

2.There are total of 13 columns, I need to analyze and decide whether I should include all of them as predictors.
